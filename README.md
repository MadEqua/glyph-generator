# glyph-generator

Glyph Generator is a procedural generator of glyphs. It can generate random sets (alphabets) of glyphs for use in games, world building or just for fun. 
It features a set of parameters that can make the generated glyphs look very different every run. There's an option to export the whole alphabet as a PNG file.

Glyph Generator is not a fully fledged tool, it's a prototype made for [#PROCJAM 2014](https://itch.io/jam/procjam2014), using [Processing](https://processing.org/) as a Java library ([Reference](https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/)).
